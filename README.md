MM/1 Software and Hardware Updates and Notes

First of All, A big Thank You goes out to Paul Ward, from IMS, Inc. for Designing the MM/1 System.

Update 10/22/2023

I hope to soon get my MM/1 up and running with newer technology.

First is to start with an upgrade to the Minibus.

I have a working prototype that supports the newer ATX Power Supply.
