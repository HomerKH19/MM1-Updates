# MM1-Updates

MM/1 Hardware & Software Updates and Notes.

10/27/2023

First of All, A big Thank You goes out to Paul Ward, from IMS, Inc. and Kevin Pease for Designing the MM/1 System in the early 90's.

Also a BIG THANKS goes out to the following people's help: Pedro Pena, Joel Ewy & David Graham.
The latter two helped with the troubleshooting back in the 90's for Paul & Kevin.

I hope to soon get my MM/1 up and running with a new ATX power supply.

First is to start with an upgrade to the Minibus.

I have a working prototype that supports the newer ATX Power Supply.

Here is the picture of Pedro's build:
